Capacitive Contribution Analysis

This work consists of a series of meticulously designed and validated Python scripts, focusing on the theoretical calculation and visualization of capacitive contributions in electrochemical systems. The code efficiently simulates and analyzes electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) behavior, combined with Faradaic processes and pseudocapacitive characteristics, providing accurate evaluation and separation of capacitive contributions. The code includes the following features:

Area-based calculation of capacitive contributions from cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves.
Flexible visualization, including red-filled regions to intuitively display capacitive contributions.
Parametric heatmap analysis for variables such as scan rate, series resistance (Rs), and parallel resistance (Rp).
Integration of EDLC, pseudocapacitance, and Faradaic behavior for comprehensive studies.
Precise computational models, including area integration and linear fitting, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy.

This work is highly suitable for researchers in electrochemical energy storage, enabling the analysis of capacitive contributions in supercapacitors, batteries, and pseudocapacitive materials. It not only aids in understanding capacitive behavior in complex systems but also provides guidance for the design and optimization of new materials.
